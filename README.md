# els_stress_interview
The scripts in the repository are for wrangling and scoring of child/adolescent stress interviews for The Stanford Neurodevelopment, Affect, and Psychopathology (SNAP)lab study of the consequences of early life stress (ELS) for psychobiological development over the pubertal transition.

As described in King et al. (2017, 2019, 2020), the SNAP Lab recruited 218 early adolescents ages 9-13 and their parents from the community to participate in a longitudinal study of the psychobiological effects of ELS across the transition through puberty. Following recruitment, 4  participants were excluded from the 
final sample (2 withdrew, 1 had a medical illness, and 1 did not respond after initial contact). At time 1 (T1) and at time 2 (T2; approximately 2 years later), 
we interviewed adolescents about their lifetime exposure to 30 types of stressors using a modified version of the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory for 
Children (Ribbe, 1996). All questions from the original version of the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory were retained; modifications involved adding questions about experiences that may not rise to the level of trauma but that are nevertheless significant stressors (e.g., financial/resource problems, family mental illness/sub- stance abuse, or family members moving in and out). In addition to themstructured questions, both childrenresponded to a final open-ended question asking about exposure to any other stressors not covered by the structured questions.

A panel of three coders, blind to the children’s reactions and behaviors during the interview, then rated the objective severity of each type of stressor 
endorsed using a modified version of the UCLA Life Stress Interview coding system (Rudolph and Hammen, 1999; Rudolph et al., 2000). Specifically, a trained 
research assistant transcribed and delivered to the panel a description of each stressor, removing details that would reveal the child’s subjective perception 
of severity. Coders then made severity ratings on a scale of 0–4, increasing in half-point increments (0 = non-event or no impact; 4 = extremely severe impact; 
ICC = 0.99). Following coding, we created an index of the level of ELS severity by summing the severity ratings for each type of stressor the child endorsed. 
This method overcomes problems with operationalizing ELS as the number of stressors that children report. Such methods inaccurately equate children who report the same number of stressful experiences but who differ substantially in their experiences of severity. We have also created indicesfor the the level of ELS severity 
corresponding to experiences of threat (King et al., 2020) and to specific developmental periods (e.g., Humphreys et al., 2019).
